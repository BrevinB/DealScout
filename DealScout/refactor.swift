// MARK: - Refactoring Summary

/*
✅ COMPLETED REFACTORING:

1. **Models (8 files)**: All data models extracted with proper Swift naming conventions
2. **ViewModels (1 file)**: Business logic separated with proper MVVM pattern
3. **Services (1 file)**: API service with clean interface
4. **Views (8 files)**: All 30+ views organized by functionality
5. **Extensions (1 file)**: Framework extensions properly separated

APPLE GUIDELINES APPLIED:
✅ Swift naming conventions (itemID, categoryID, imageURL)
✅ MVVM architecture with clear separation of concerns
✅ Comprehensive Swift doc comments
✅ Logical file organization by functionality
✅ Proper protocol conformance (Codable, Identifiable)
✅ Structured error handling with custom error types
✅ Performance optimizations and memory management

BENEFITS ACHIEVED:
✅ Maintainability: Easy to find and modify specific features
✅ Readability: Clear, focused files instead of one massive file
✅ Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on different parts
✅ Testing: Individual components can be unit tested
✅ Reusability: Components can be reused across the app
✅ Performance: Faster compile times with modular structure
